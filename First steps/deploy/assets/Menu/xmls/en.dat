        <title1 style='title'>EDUCATIONAL VALUES
GENERAL</title1>
        <note ready='true' style='note'>//i//Note:// For the child to learn all the values and skills described below, Comfy created various CD games for your child’s age and learning stage of development.</note>
        <frame1 ready='false' style='normal'>The Comfy Keyboard and software has been created and designed by a pedagogical research and development team that specializes in technology media to suit the capabilities and interests of children between the ages of 1 to 5. The big, illustrated keys, easily gripped handset and Spin-Roller are easily controlled by little hands, enabling the child independence and comfortable control, without requiring reading skills or use of the computer mouse.</frame1>
        <frame2 >Playing in Comfy’s interactive environment will provide your child with the following:

**Learning through play and exploration.
**Acquiring basic computer skills.
**Developing cognitive, emotional and social skills.

The following qualities make Comfy's approach unique and well suited to attaining its educational goals:

**The activities are an interactive combination of stories,
  animated films, viewing pictures and color painting,
  hearing music and singing songs, motor activities
  and exposure to social concepts.</frame2>
 
 <frame3 style='normal'>**The Comfy Keyboard replaces the standard keyboard and
  mouse. Each key is colorful and easy to use.
  Reading and writing skills are not required.
  
**Comfy activities are age-appropriate and the characters
  and objects in the story are amiable and amusing.
  
**Once the level is adapted to your child's stage
  of development and the activity begins, your child
  can play without parental assistance. The computer
  characters talk to your child and explain what to do
  at every stage in the activity. Each explanation is
  accompanied by a variety of illustrated graphics
  and animations.</frame3>

<frame4 style='normal'>**Comfy has created innumerable educational opportunities
  for parent-child cooperation during and after an activity.
  As a parent, you and your family will enjoy sharing
  endless experiences with your child.

The following sections provide a brief description of children's skills and developmental patterns and elaborate on how Comfy contributes in the development of your child’s sensory perception, motor, cognitive and emotional skills.
</frame4>

<title5 style='title'>EDUCATIONAL VALUES
MOTOR AND SENSORY SKILLS</title5>
<frame5 style='normal'>//h1//Motor and Sensory Skills

As children grow, their physical and mental skills develop, enabling them to perform more complex tasks. Your child learns to identify objects and characters, correctly interpret stimuli from immediate surroundings and develop the senses.

When playing with Comfy, your child learns to:
**Correlate between the objects and characters he or she
   sees on the screen with those on the Comfy Keyboard.
**Improve visual perception by distinguishing different
   shapes and colors.
**Improve hearing perception.
</frame5>
        <title6 style='title'>EDUCATIONAL VALUES
LANGUAGE SKILLS</title6>
        <frame6 style='normal'>//h1//Language Skills
	
Children’s vocabulary is constantly expanding as they learn to construct sentences.

With Comfy your child can:
**Learn how to phrase questions, requests, warnings and
   instructional sentences.
**Gain knowledge of new concepts pertaining to specific
   topics such as the weather, mail and time.</frame6>
   
<title7 style='title'>EDUCATIONAL VALUES
THINKING SKILLS</title7>
<frame7 style='normal'>//h1//Thinking Skills
	
Children's memory capacity is gradually enhanced enabling them to remember more and more pictures, voices and experiences. In addition, their imagination develops and improves their creative and thinking skills.

Playing with Comfy can help your child to:
**Enhance understanding of cause and effect.
   Understanding relationships by allowing the child
   to intervene in an evolving story and cause changes
   to take place (e.g., make it rain, change day to night).
**Practice remembering objects, sounds, voices,
   events and characters throughout an activity.
</frame7>

<frame8 style='normal'>**Develop his/her imagination by participating in the
   story's plot and influencing it as desired.
  
**Participate in "make-believe play" with the Comfy characters
   and learn from them about the world they live in.
  
**Learn to concentrate and apply mental effort by performing
   challenging tasks.
</frame8>

<title9 style='title'>EDUCATIONAL VALUES
EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT</title9>
<frame9 style='normal'>//h1//Emotional Development

Children require a warm and supportive environment as well as clear definitions of limitations and prohibitions. This allows them to develop independence and enquire about their surroundings and initiate activities in an endeavor to strengthen their self-confidence and self-image.

Comfy presents your child with:
**Positive experiences, from discovering changing colors
  and sounds to meeting friendly characters.
**Vital feedback and encouragement whilst
  using the keyboard.
**A chance to relieve impulses by using the Spin-Roller
  on the Comfy Keyboard.
 </frame9>
        <frame10 style='normal'>**A sense of control of the Comfy Keyboard, the events in
  the activities and the way the plot evolves. A sense of
  control improves the child's confidence and self-image.
  
**A clear definition of game rule limitations
  (for example; Buddy the bear asks the child to make
  it rain "but not now- only in a little while, after
  I get home"). </frame10>
        <title11 style='title'>EDUCATIONAL VALUES
SOCIAL VALUES AND BEHAVIOR</title11>
		<frame11 style='normal'>//h1//Social Values and Behavior
		
Young children learn accepted forms of behavior by becoming acquainted with social and cultural norms. With Comfy games, they learn appropriate behavior patterns and how to overcome social difficulties and obstacles.

In this area, Comfy:
**Helps your child participate in and learn appropriate
  behavior in various daily situations.
**Presents characters that your child can identify with.
**Emphasizes positive social norms such as cooperation
  and the value of assisting others.
**Comfy introduces the positive values of friendship,
  compromise and respect for every being and object.

<!-------------------------------------------      WELCOME    ( about comfy)  ----------------------------------------------------->

<welcome>
<frame1 ready='true' style='normal'>At Comfy, it is our firm belief that the most important element in raising a content lively child is to provide him or her with a safe environment that both interests and supports.

One aspect of this support can come in the form of constructive play that involves both the child and his family. Games that challenge the child and support him in discovering solutions encourage a love for learning while bolstering confidence and self-esteem. 

A computer is the ideal conduit for this type of constructive play. Many children are fascinated by their parent's computers, and Comfy's interactive products enable children to explore their surroundings and expand their capabilities in an environment specifically designed for them. 
</frame1>
<frame2>The Comfy products are visually appealing, offer stimulating material, and prompt the child's imagination. The games' design allows children to experiment and to make new discoveries without fear of errors or failure, giving them the increased confidence in their abilities, and the possibility of using Comfy products independently, not needing parent's guidance.

Playing with Comfy products can help the child achieve personal goals and, with the right guidance, improve his cognitive, social and emotional abilities. We believe that every child has the potential to learn through fun play, and to attain a sense of personal achievement through learning.
We hope that you have many hours of fun with Comfy. There is no limit to how much we can learn.</frame2>

		<Mtitle3 style='title'>PARENTS’ ROLE IN MAXIMIZING COMFY 3C SYSTEM</Mtitle3>
		<frame1 style='normal'>//h3//Comfy Pedagogical House (CPH)// is the research and development arm of Comfy, responsible for accumulating all knowledge and information, identifying the latest trends in child-development and learning processes, in order to implement them into interactive fun-learning products.

CPH activities include research and field-testing, involving many experts from various fields, which together form the wide knowledge base for Comfy’s activities.

CPH is the developer of Comfy’s unique 3C Developmental Cycle™ to encourage children's curiosity, while promoting and maximizing effective learning.</frame1>



        <frame2>The immediate effect that is seen when watching a child play with the Comfy system is the magic sparkle in his eyes lighting up his whole face. This is what we refer to as "Comfy's Magic Effect". This magical effect is created by the combination of //h3//C//uriosity //PLUS// //h3//C//hallenge //PLUS// //h3//C//onfidence = //h3//3C Developmental Cycle™//

//h3//Curiosity//
Children are born with natural curiosity. At Comfy, we expose young minds to a rich interactive environment in order to leverage their natural–born curiosity and take them through a journey of learning through play and exploration, enabling the development of new skills and thought-patterns.</frame2>

<frame3>//h3//Challenge//
By providing children with age-appropriate, rich and developmental content, we motivate and inspire them to utilize their capabilities to the fullest. Therefore, CPH has created a line of software for children aged 1-5 years old, developing motor skills, emotional intelligence, visual and spatial perception, creative thinking, vocabulary, languages and much more.

//h3//Confidence//
The Comfy system develops self-confidence by enabling the child to play independently - being able to control the activities as an active participant rather than a passive one. Acquiring this sense of control improves the child’s confidence and self-esteem and is the basis for building a stable personality as well as healthy relationships.
